This directory contains test scripts for the simulator. They consist of a
series of messages that the QoS server sends to the video delivery server.
The idea is to run the QoS server using one of these test scripts and then
inspect the transcript.log and vidserver.log files to see if the video
delivery server behaved correctly.
